# ML_trainings_sessions

Draft for Seminars on this course "Introduction to ML":

1)  __Overview of Machine Learning world__: (Difference between AI/Machine Learning (ML)/Neural Networks, Motivation for ML, Examples of application, Unsupervised Learning (Clustering: K-means, DBSCAN), Supervised Learning (Classification+Regression: Na√Øve Bayes, SVM, Decision Tree, Linear/Polynomial Regression), semble methods (Stacking, Boosting, Bagging), Neural Networks (General idea and examples))

2)  __Introduction to python__: (loops, if-else conditions, try-except structures, lists, list operations, dictionaries, read files, write files, how to use pip, functions, classes, inheritance, modules, generators, iterators,  etc.)

2)       Introduction to Numpy (advantages of vector representation and comparison with ordinary lists, speed comparison)

3)       Introduction to Pandas

4)       Introduction to Sklearn (main library for Machine Learning algorithms)

5)       Introduction to Keras (library for Deep Learning/Neural Networks in python). Examples on real cases

6)       Theoretical material on Machine Learning (Linear models, metrics, Loss function, derivatives, optimization, Gradient descent, trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, Unsupervised learning, etc.)

7)       Theoretical material on Deep Learning (Multilayer perceptron, chain rule, backpropagation, matrix derivatives, Dense layer, convolutional layer, CNN, Generative models, Autoencoders, etc. )
